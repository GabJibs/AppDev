# My Favorite Series

**Transformers and why I it's my favorite series.**
**Transformers** is a series about the never ending war between the heroic **Autobots** and the evil **Decepticons**. Two factions of sentient alien robots who transforms into cars.
On the surface that seems silly and to an extent it is but over the years Transformers has evolved to become more than just that. With numerous adaptations and stories that explores it's
concepts and themes. Which range from fun light hearted adventures to dark a moral stories that emphasizes the horrors of war and the devistation it brings not only on both factions, but to
the environment around them. Here are a few reasons why I like this series.

1. Characters and their depictions in each adaptation 
2. Fast Paste and well choreographed Action
3. Story
